# Encrypted Messaging App
The encryption aspect of my NEA project. Includes Diffie Hellman (Generating secret keys) and AES (encrypting/decrypting messages using a secret key)
Updated as part of my PDP to add a CBC encryption/decryption mode which is more secure as it makes use of an initilization matrix and uses the whole message.
